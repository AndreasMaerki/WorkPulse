# WorkPulse

WorkPulse is a macOS time tracking application built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. It helps users track their time across different activities with a modern, intuitive interface.

## Project Status

**Note: This project is a work in progress and serves (among other things) as an experiment to assess the usefulness of AI coding agents in software development.**

While the macOS version is functional, I am actively developing new features and improvements. A mobile client for iOS is planned for future development, which will allow users to track their time on the go and sync with their desktop data.
